    "description": "Back in 1990 Rolling Stone called it “like nothing else on television.”\n\n25 years later, it’s still like nothing else on television.\n\nTwin Peaks radically changed the concept of prime time TV: its serialized format, its central mystery, its weirdness.  Unfortunately, it was so ahead of its time that just like its heroine Laura Palmer, it met with an untimely end, and after just 2 seasons it was canceled.\n\nBut Videology is bringing it back! No, we’re not producing the 3rd season here at Videology (we’re leaving that to someone else), but we’re doing the next best thing: we’re watching it and playing bingo! What better way to celebrate this groundbreaking show than to gather with fellow Twin Peaks lovers and play a damn fine game of bingo!",
